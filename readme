Student 1: What authorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of
information given in the "Policies" web page (also available on armlab
in the file ~cos217/AuthorizedSourcesList ) to this section of the
readme file, and edit it as appropriate.

Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

particular, what bugs are in your submission?

What is your mywc program test plan?

mywcboundary1letter.txt: The file contains "a", therefore testing the 
boundary case where there is only one character, which counts as a word too.

mywcboundary1newline.txt: The file contains a new line, therefore testing
the boundary case where there is only a new line, with no other characters.
This counts as a character and new line.

mywcboundary1space.txt: The file contains a space, therefore testing the boundary
case where there is only one character.

mywcboundaryempty.txt: The file contains nothing, and therefore has zero of everything.

In total, lines 32, 36, 38/39, 44, 45, 49, and 53 need to be checked
by the statement tests.

mywcstatement1word.txt: The file contains 1 word "test," and tests
mywc.c for lines 32, 44, 45, and 53, and mywc.s for lines 41, 73, 77, 
and 104. The while loop is entered because the file is nonempty, so 32
runs. Since there aren't spaces, the condition for 44 will run. The first
iteration, the condition on 44 will pass, since the program hasn't entered
"test" before. Line 45 will run. In later iterations, 44 will fail and 45 won't
run. Since iInWord is never set FALSE again, 53 runs, passing 52's condition.

mywcstatement1line4words.txt: The file contains 4 words, with no new line:
"This is a test". It tests mywc.c for lines (only listing those
that haven't already been tested) 36 and 38/39. It tests mywc.s (only
listing those that haven't already been tested) for lines 54 and 59/63. 
Since there are spaces now, right before the program enters "is", 34's condition will be met, 
so the program will test the condition in 36. Because iInWord is not set FALSE 
elsewhere, lines 38/39 will run.

mywcstatement2lines4words.txt: The file contains 8 words, with 1 new line:
"This is a test
This is a test". 
It tests mywc.c for line (only listing those
that haven't already been tested) 49. It tests mywc.s (only
listing those that haven't already been tested) for line 90. 
Since there is a new line now, right before the program enters the second "The", 
48's condition will be met, so 49 will run.

mywcstatementmultiplespaces.txt: The file contains "This  is a test", where
it is identical to mywcstatement1line4words.txt but with an extra space. This doesn't
test any explicit line, but tests for the case where the condition on line 34 is called
but fails since there's a consecutive space, so 38 doesn't run.

mywcstresstest.txt: The file takes a random string of characters from stresstest.c,
by running ./stresstest >> mywcstresstest.txt. By running high quantities of random characters,\
words, and lines, it stress tests the program.
